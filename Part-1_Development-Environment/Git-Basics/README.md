# Git Basics

Master the #1 tool every developer uses for tracking changes and collaboration!

## 🎯 What is Git?

Git is a **version control system** that tracks changes in your code over time. Think of it as a "time machine" for your projects that lets you:

- **Save snapshots** of your work at any point
- **Go back** to previous versions if something breaks
- **Collaborate** with others without conflicts
- **Track who changed what** and when
- **Merge** different versions of your code

## 🌟 Why Git is Essential

### For Students
- **Never lose your work** - Even if your computer crashes
- **Track your progress** - See how your skills improve over time
- **Collaborate on group projects** - Work together without conflicts
- **Build a portfolio** - Show your coding journey to colleges/employers

### For Developers
- **Industry standard** - Every tech company uses Git
- **Professional workflow** - How real development teams work
- **Code backup** - Your code is safe in the cloud
- **Project management** - Organize features and fixes

## 💡 Real-World Applications

### Academic Projects
```bash
# Semester-long project tracking
git init my-research-project
git add research-paper.md
git commit -m "Initial research outline"

# Track changes over time
git add updated-analysis.py
git commit -m "Add statistical analysis code"

# Collaborate with study group
git push origin main
```

### Personal Projects
```bash
# Website development
git init my-portfolio
git add index.html style.css
git commit -m "Initial portfolio structure"

# Feature development
git checkout -b new-blog-section
git add blog.html
git commit -m "Add blog section"
git merge new-blog-section
```

## 🛡️ Best Practices from Day 1

### Commit Message Guidelines
```bash
# ✅ Good commit messages
git commit -m "Add user login functionality"
git commit -m "Fix navigation menu bug"
git commit -m "Update README with installation instructions"

# ❌ Bad commit messages
git commit -m "stuff"
git commit -m "fixed it"
git commit -m "changes"
```

### Repository Organization
```
my-project/
├── README.md              # Project description
├── .gitignore            # Files to ignore
├── src/                  # Source code
├── docs/                 # Documentation
├── tests/                # Test files
└── assets/               # Images, etc.
```

### Safety Guidelines
- **Commit often** - Small, frequent commits are better
- **Test before committing** - Make sure your code works
- **Write clear messages** - Explain what and why
- **Review before pushing** - Check what you're sharing

## 🔧 Common Issues and Solutions

### "Git command not found"
```bash
# Check if Git is installed
git --version

# If not installed, go to git-scm.com
# Or use package manager (Mac: brew install git)
```

### "Permission denied"
```bash
# Usually SSH key issue
# Check: ssh -T git@github.com
# Fix: Set up SSH keys properly
```

### "Merge conflicts"
```bash
# Don't panic! We'll cover this in detail
# Basic approach:
# 1. Open conflicted files
# 2. Choose which changes to keep
# 3. Remove conflict markers
# 4. Commit the resolution
```
